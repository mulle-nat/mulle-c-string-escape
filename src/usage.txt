Usage:
	mulle-c-string-escape [options] [infile] [outfile]

âž¿ mulle-c-string-escape turns data into C-strings

It will escape non-ASCII characters to hex or octal, and use C-escapes for the
known C escapes. It will separate the output into lines so they should fit
a visually pleasing line length.

You can easily `#include` the output, or just copy/paste it.

Reads from standard input and writes to standard output. You can also use
it on binary files.

Example:
	mulle-c-string-escape -0 -l 120 < mytext.txt

Options:
	-[01234] : zero to four space prefix (TAB)
	-h       : help
	-e       : escape TAB characters
	-l <n>   : targetted line length (80)
	-n       : don't create a new line for linefeeds in text
	-p <s>   : use a custom prefix instead of spaces or TAB
	-t <s>   : visual size of TAB in text (8)
