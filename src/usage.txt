Usage:
   mulle-c-string-escape [options] [infile] [outfile]

   âž¿ mulle-c-string-escape turns data into C-strings

   Non-ASCII characters will be escaped to hex or octal. C-escapes are used for
   known C escapes like '\b'. The output is separated into lines of approximately
   even length and does not exceed the chosen line length.
   You can feed it binary or text files.

   You can then easily `#include` the output, or copy/paste it into your
   C program like so:

      static char  data[] =
      #include "data.inc"
      ;
      #define s_data  (sizeof( data) - 1)

Example:
   mulle-c-string-escape -0 -l 120 < mytext.txt

Options:
   -[01234] : zero to four space prefix (TAB)
   -c       : append ".inc" to infile to generate outfile
   -e       : escape TAB characters
   -h       : this help
   -l <n>   : targetted line length (80)
   -n       : don't create a new line for linefeeds in text
   -p <s>   : use a custom prefix instead of spaces or TAB
   -t <s>   : visual size of TAB in text (8)
   -v       : print version information and exit
